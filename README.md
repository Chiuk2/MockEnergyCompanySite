# MockEnergyCompanySite
This project is a mock website for a mock energy company. There's a homepage that displays the directory and the mission statement of the company. The page will take the user to the pages products & services, Q&A, About the company, and Contact. This was run using Xamp, locally. And was created in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL.
